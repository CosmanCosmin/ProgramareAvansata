Create classes in order to model the problem. You may assume that all possible tokens are initially available, having random values.
Each player will have a name and they must perform in a concurrent manner, extracting repeatedly tokens from the board.
Simulate the game using a thread for each player.
Pay attention to the synchronization of the threads when extracting tokens from the board
